Given a candidate's resume and a job description, return ONLY the candidate's
resume skills that clearly align with the job requirements.

Rules:
- Focus on technical/engineering skills only (programming languages, databases, frameworks,
  CS fundamentals, domain knowledge, tools, cloud platforms, etc.).
- Exclude soft skills (communication, leadership, teamwork, time management, etc.).
- Only include skills that are present in the resume AND relevant to the job description.
- Deduplicate and keep the list focused (0-8 items).
- Assign a match_level to each skill: "low", "medium", or "high".
- Return the response as structured data matching the schema.

eg user mentioned working with FastAPI in resume within projects or experience section and the JD mentioned experience with FastAPI or experience with Python and web frameworks then it should be a high match level. If the JD mentioned experience with Python but not FastAPI specifically, it could be also high match level. If the JD mentioned experience with a different web framework (like Django) but not FastAPI or Python, it could be a medium match level.
